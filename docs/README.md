# How it was built

In progress. It's all changed!

To get the most out of the "labs", and I use that term loosely, you should have some theoretical understanding of kubernetes. Some good resources are:

- [Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) with Practice Exam Tests](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/)
- [Kubernetes in Action by Marko Luksa](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34013922-kubernetes-in-action)

## Let's get started

1. [Single Node](docs/build.md)
   
   Jump straight into setting up a docker container for a single node kubernetes cluster.

2. [Package](docs/package.md)
   
   We package up what we have learned ready for the next task.

3. [Testing and Fixing](/docs/testfix.md)
   
   This thing has bugs. Let's fix it.

4. [Kubernetes the Hard Way](/docs/k8shardway.md)
   
   The classic remade for MOK. A 7 node cluster without blowing up your laptop!

5. Multi Node
   
   Build a bigger cluster using our package.

6. [Upgrade](/docs/upgrade.md)
   
   We can install any version of kubernetes. Let's try installing an older cluster and upgrading it.

7. [Add-ons](/docs/addons.md)
   
   Trying popluar kubernetes add-ons.
